				<h2 class="subtitle">Are Cookies Disappearing?</h2>
				<p>Cookies have become ingrained in the Internet and are likely here to stay for some time. However, they are likely to change and evolve with new Internet technologies and user concerns. Cookie usage is on a general upwards trend that isn't likely to drop anytime soon.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">The Internet of Things</h2>
				<p>One evolution in cookies that will likely gain traction in the next few years is expanding cookies to the Internet of Things. With the way cookies work now, a user's phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop are all given different unique identifiers and are therefore treated as completely separate. Future work will likely figure out how to "link" a user's different devices together to get a more holistic and detailed idea of how users engage with the Internet.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Protection and Security</h2>
				<p>Another evolution that will be explored more in the future is protection of data. As cookies become more popular, there is a larger amount of data and therefore larger concern of how that data is collected, handled, and protected. Future work will likely research how data is currently protected and how that may be improved in the future.<sup>1</sup> A related concern to this research is increased government regulation. As countries pass laws such as GDPR, websites will be held more accountable for how data is collected and protected.<sup>2</sup></p>
