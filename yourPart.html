				<h2 class="subtitle firstSection" id="average">Cookies, Ads, and Effects on the Average User</h2>
					<p>As we have seen, cookies are commonly used to track users and personalize advertisements. However, they can also be used for a number of other purposes, such as saving settings, creating online shopping carts, and persisting login sessions. Whether you view cookies' ability to track users in a positive or negative light, there is no denying that the modern Internet experience would be impossible without them. The average user is affected by cookies in more ways than you might think; even the possibility of online login sessions is due to cookies. While tracking and personalized advertisements are gaining popularity and notoriety, cookies have also affected the Internet in very positive ways.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Privacy Concerns</h2>
					<p>Due to the negative aspects of cookies, the average user may have a number of privacy concerns, including:<sup>1</sup></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Anonymity</li>
						<li>Unintended use of cookies</li>
						<li>Surreptitious nature of data collection</li>
						<li>Trespassing into the web users' own resources</li>
						<li>Threat of cookie sharing</li>
					</ul>
					<p>While these concerns are valid, there are a number of steps that can be taken to minimize risk of data leakage, trespassing, or cookie sharing.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Steps You Can Take</h2>
					<p>As mentioned above, there are a number of simple steps you can take to minimize the negative impact of cookies in your online life.</p>

					<h3 class="subSub">Delete Cookies Regularly</h3>
					<p>The simplest step you can take to minimize concerns is to delete your cookie files regularly. All major browsers have this option in their settings, and your operating system likely has a similar option in its storage settings. This will get rid of old or unwanted cookies, simultaneously freeing up space on your computer and making sure lingering trackers are removed.</p>

					<h3 class="subSub">Use an Ad Blocker</h3>
					<p>As previously discussed, ad blockers can't do much more than your standard browser settings can. However, it is still good to have an additional layer of protection, and an ad blocker can often make up for some missed settings in your browser. At the very least, an ad blocker will prevent you from seeing personalized ads. This will prevent ad companies from tracking you through ad interactions and may assuage some of your fears by getting rid of the glaring personalizations.</p>

					<h3 class="subSub">Set Up "Do Not Track" Requests in Your Browser</h3>
					<p>A good rule of thumb is to set up "do not track" requests directly within your web browser. This will notify websites that you do not want to receive tracking cookies. As mentioned previously, nearly every cookie prevention method has a loophole; however, having "do not track" requests will certainly cut down on the number of third-party cookies you receive.</p>

					<h3 class="subSub">Don't Accept Terms You Don't Understand</h3>
					<p>Many websites are now including banners that inform the user of their use of cookies. However, just because you are informed doesn't mean that the website will be responsible in collecting and handling your data. Always read a website's privacy policy and terms and conditions, and don't agree to a policy that you do not understand. This will increase your autonomy over your data and ensure that you are informed about how your data is collected and used.</p>
