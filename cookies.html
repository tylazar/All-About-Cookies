				<h2 class="subtitle firstSection" id="intro">Introduction to Cookies</h2>
				<p>Cookies, in a nutshell, are "the small files used by companies to collect information about Internet users."<sup>1</sup> They were introduced in 1994 by Lou Montulli who developed them while working at Netscape. The name "cookie" comes from their direct ancestor, "magic cookies", or little bits of code sent back and forth between machines for purposes of identification.<sup>2</sup> A cookie is a small text file that a Web server creates and saves on the user's hard drive. If you've ever done a disk cleanup, you've probably seen the amount of files generated by your browser; many of these files are cookies from various websites. They were originally created to "enhance the user's interaction with the Web by enabling a user to return to a site to resume interaction where it was left off on the previous visit."<sup>3</sup> In other words, cookies were developed to give the Web a memory and save users the hassle of resubmitting data and re-navigating through pages.</p>

				<p>Today, cookies are still used for saving sessions - they are very popular with online shopping websites like Amazon. They're also common for saving personalization settings - for example, choosing dark mode, setting volumes, and enabling or disabling captions on a video. They are also commonly used for tracking purposes, which is used for advertisement personalization. Advertisers use these cookies to keep track of what users are looking at and interacting with, allowing them to tailor ads to the individual user.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle" id="how">How Cookies Work</h2>
				<p>As mentioned above, a cookie is just a small file that is created by a Web server and saved on your hard drive. This file is essentially a personalized description form. Each cookie file has various identifying fields, including a name, value, and various attributes like expiration time, domain, and special flags.<sup>4</sup> The value is the most significant part of a cookie. It is a string of characters that represent various pieces of information about you, such as passwords, names, or addresses. Cookies are sent back in forth within the header of HTTP packets. When a user first visits a website, the Web server sends an empty cookie file to be stored. As the user interacts with the site, information is added to the cookie and sent back to the Web server. When the website is accessed at a later time, the server will detect a cookie with a matching identifier to the one it would have sent and instead automatically loads the data from the already-existing cookie.
				</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle" id="types">Types of Cookies</h2>
				<p>There are multiple kinds of cookies. The most prevalent are first-party, third-party, session cookies, and flash cookies.</p>

				<h3 class="subSub">First-Party Cookies</h3>
				<p>First-party cookies are also known as persistent cookies. First-party cookies are very in-line to the general discussion above; they are stored on a device's memory and have an expiration.<sup>5</sup> Once a first-party cookie reaches its expiration date, it is destroyed. First-party cookies are only used by the website that created them. Furthermore, the creating website decides the expiration date, and therefore how long the cookie lasts. These kinds of cookies are commonly used for online shopping carts and setting personalization.</p>

				<h3 class="subSub">Third-Party Cookies</h3>
				<p>Third-party cookies are also known as "tracking cookies". They are "commonly used to track users across different websites by companies that have no relationship with consumers."<sup>6</sup> Like first-party cookies, third-party cookies are stored on your device and come with an expiration date. The largest difference between first-party and third-party cookies is that third-party cookies are accessed by websites that did not create them - most commonly, advertising websites. When someone is worried about the dangers of cookies, they are probably referring to third-party cookies.</p>

				<h3 class="subSub">Session Cookies</h3>
				<p>Session cookies are the most basic type of cookie. They exist only in temporary memory and are deleted when you close the browser. They do not collect any information about the user, and usually only have a session ID which is used to persist data over time or between page navigations. A common use of session cookies is to store a user's login status. This way, they will not have to login every time they click on a new page.</p>

				<h3 class="subSub">Flash Cookies</h3>
				<p>Flash cookies were developed in 2005 by United Virtualities in response to users frequently deleting other types of cookies.<sup>3</sup> Flash cookies are more persistent than first-party, third-party, and session cookies (collectively known as "HTTP cookies") in that they have no default expiration date. In rare cases, a flash cookie may even recreate an HTTP cookie once it has been deleted. They're also stored in a different location than HTTP cookies, so they aren't caught by many device cleanup programs. This is partly due to the important roles often played by flash cookies: they are often used to deliver online videos, games, and animation. By deleting or rejecting flash cookies, a user may miss out on some of the experiences the web has to offer.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle" id="prevalence">Prevalence of Cookies</h2>
				<p>Cookies have become extremely popular on the modern Internet. You have probably seen banners on websites informing you that they use cookies, and you must agree to their use in order to continue. Here are some statistics on exactly how common cookies have become:<sup>7</sup></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Persistent cookies are used by 23.4% of all websites.</li>
					<li>Cookies in general are used by 45.9% of all websites.</li>
					<li>Of created persistent cookies, 39.1% of them have expiration dates in the range of months.</li>
					<li>The usage of cookies since 2012 has dropped by 3%.</li>
					<li>Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, Amazon, and Twitter all use persistent cookies.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>When reading these statistics, keep in mind the huge number of websites on the Internet. Many of these websites are small, locally hosted sites that don't get much traffic. Popular websites almost always utilize cookies.</p>
