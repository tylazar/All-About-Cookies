				<h1>Cookies</h1>
				<p>Intro to cookies
	- "the small files used by companies to collect information about Internet users" (Cookies and Privacy, pg. 51)
	- "a small text file that is saved on a user's harddrive by a Web server" (same as above)
	- "Cookies perform state management functions, 	which assist Web sites in maintaining information about the state of their users or what their users are doing" (same as above)
	- Used for saving sessions and personalization, like in online shopping
	- Also used for tracking

	How they work
		- Cookies are dealt with in the header of an HTTP packet
		- Has a:
			- name
			- value
			- zero or more attributes, such as expiration, domain, and flags like Secure and HttpOnly (HTTP Cookies a Promising Technology)
		- The value of a cookie is a string of characters that represent pieces of information about you - things like passwords or form information
		- The server sends a cookie to the browser when accessing a website with cookies, which is stored on the local machine
		- Information on the user side is added to the cookies and sent back to the server
		- When the same website is accessed, the server will see a matching cookie and load the dat automatically 
		- decription form (HTTP Cookies a Promising Technology)

	Types of cookies
		- There are several kinds of cookies: first-party, third-party (TPCs), session, and Flash

	First-party cookies
		-First-party cookies are also called persistent cookies
		- "Written onto your device's memory and come with an expiration date" (privacy.net)
		- Only used by the website that made them, and last as long as the website dictates

	Third-party cookies (TPCs)
		- Also known as tracking cookies
		- "TPCs are commonly used to track users across different websites by companies that have no relationship with consumers" (Behavioral Advertising, pg. 276)
		- Also stored onto your device's memory and have an expiration date (privacy.net)
		- Accessed on websites that didn't create them
		- These are the ones people worry about most

	Session cookies
		- Session cookies are the most basic type
		- Session only exist in temporary memory and are deleted when you close the browse (Privacy.net)

	Flash cookies
		- United Virtualities (UV) developed flash cookies in 2005 as a response to users deleting their cookies (Online Privacy Concerns, pg. 3)
		- More persistent than HHTP cookies - have no default expiration date (^^)
		- May (rarely) recreate a deleted HTTP cookie (^^)
		- Stored in a different location than HTTP cookies
		- A users experience could be impacted by rejecting Flash cookies: they are used to deliver online videos, games, and animation

	History of cookies
		- "Cookies were initially intended to enhance the user's interaction with the Web by enabling a user to return to a site to resume interaction where it was left off on the previous visit" (Online Privacy Concerns, pg. 2)
		- Introduced by Lou Montulli in 1994 while working at Netscape
		- Direct descendent of "magic cookies," little bits of code sent back and forth between machines for identification (Giving Web a Memory Cost Its Users Privacy)

	Prevalence
		- Persistent cookies are used by 23.4% of all websites
		- Cookies in general are used by 45.9% of all websites
		- Of created persistent cookies, 39.1% of them have expiration dates in the range of months
		- The usage of cookies since 2012 has dropped slightly - 48.9% in Jan 2012, 45.9% now
		- Google, Youtube, Wikipedia, Amazon, and Twitter all use persistent cookies
