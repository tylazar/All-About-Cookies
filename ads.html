				<h1>Advertisements</h1>
				<p>
					How do cookies work with ads?
						- cookies have a key (e.g. "ID) and a value (e.g. 123), where the value is a unique identifier for the user
						- advertisers access the "ID" cookie and track how 123 visits different websites 
						- tracking like this is aggregated across different websites to create a profile of the user's identity (all above from behavioral advertising, pg. 276)
						- "marketers and advertisers use cookies for collecting demographic information about users" (cookies and privacy, pg. 53)
						- cookies are used to determine the effectiveness of ads by tracking a user after they click on an ad
					Are cookies necessary for ads?
						- no, but they do it well
						- there are alternative options, like having generic ads that are either given to everyone or randomly selected; or having users fill out preference surveys
						- cookies are desired by ad companies because they automatically get preferences, dont require user participation, and can track a large amount of data
						- "an alternative way for web sites to accomplish this is to allow users to create unique IDs and passwords for themselves." (cookies and privacy, pg. 53)
					Is this dangerous?
						- not always; flash cookies can be used to just store information like volume preferences, if you use subtitles, etc.
						- however, they can also be used for creating a "user profile"
						- when it comes down to it, this is a philosophical debate really; is a lack of privacy dangerous, or is personalized content a boon? "privacy is a dynamic and ambiguous concept" (online privacy concerns, pg. 6)
						- cookies themselves allow users to customize website featurs and save preferences (cookies and privacy, pg. 52)
						- it's collection of information without explicit consent, although websites now are putting in notices
							- note, however, that these notices often aren't "are you ok with cookies?", they're "we're using cookies and you have to be ok with it to use our site"
						- cookies can easily be seen and information can be easily accessed
					What adblockers do to cookies
						- most browsers have a "do not track" option, where it will send a request in the package header to not generate trackers (eff)
						- an ad blocker essentially does the same thing as a "do not track" option, although how often and rigorously depends on the user's configuration
						- however, researchers have done experiments that show that nearly every cookie-blocking policy can be bypassed (who left open the cookie jar)
